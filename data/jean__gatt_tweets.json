Brilliant builders are EVERYWHERE. As builders, we're not just chasing VC money anymore, we're bootstrapping, innovating, and creating sh*t from our laptops across the globe. So why can't we nurture that same vibrant community right here in Europe? Since arriving in Lisbon 1.5 years ago, it has been on my mind since D1 to build a community of Builders right here in Lisbon. And bit by bit? We're getting there. @iamgdsa and I joined forces with @_baretto to help host @IndieBeers right here in Lisbon. The result? 100 super interesting people connecting every single month.  But we're just getting started... Introducing: Indie Dinners  Our mission? Simple yet powerful. A monthly feast with 8 brilliant minds who are true BUILDERS. http://indiedinner.com This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for what's next...  until then, sign up",
